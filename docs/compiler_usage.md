## Compiler Usage

The recommended way to use conjure is via a build tool like [gradle-conjure](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-conjure). However, if you don't want to use gradle-conjure, there is also an executable published on [bintray](https://bintray.com/palantir/releases/conjure).

    Usage: conjure compile <target> <output>
