# Conjure Wire Specification

_This document defines how Conjure clients and servers should make and receive network requests and reponses over HTTP._


## HTTP Requests

TODO link to some official HTTP spec, define HTTP 1 / 1.1 / 2.


- **SSL/TLS** - Conjure clients MUST support requests using TLS (HTTPS) (TODO versions) and MAY optionally support insecure HTTP requests.

- **Path parameters** - For Conjure endpoints which have user-defined path parameters, the client MUST interpolate values for each of these path parameters, using the PLAIN format below.

  ```
  /some/url/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{id}/{file}
  ->
  /some/url/joe/recipe-server/pulls/123/var%2Fconf%2Finstall.yml
  ```

<!--
    - path parameters and encoding
    - headers
      - User-agent required,
      - fetch-user-agent ??
      - tracing (example)

    - query params, how optional empty can be omitted (refer to 'PLAIN' below)
    - Servers allow extra headers / cookies / query params
    - cookies
    - binary body type streaming upload
    - reject unknown fields
    - body serialization (refers to JSON below)
-->

## HTTP Responses

- **HTTP Methods** - servers must support Conjure's four HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` ([RFC7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4)).  Other verbs are intentionally not supported (TODO why?).

<!--
  - Responses
    - status codes
    - Clients tolerate extra headers / cookies
    - binary return type streaming download, describe optional<binary>... also empty binary, also content-length headers
    - errors (incl status codes)
    - tolerate unknown fields
    - body serialization (refers to JSON below)
-->

- Formats
  - PLAIN
  - JSON
    - coerce null/abent -> Optional.empty(), empty list, empty set
    - explain why optional<optional<T>> is banned
    - strings are UTF8
    - caveats for double Infinity NaN


- Behaviour
  - client base url
  - set equality using canonical formats (double, )
  - round-trip reserialization of unknown enum/union variants
  - server GZIP compression
  - server OPTIONS http method for browser compatibility
  - server CORS headers???
  - server http 1/2

<!--
TODO

- should we mention CIPHERS????

- strictness / leniency - can you expect that a server or a client is already compliant, should you be defensive?? (server-side : you must be defensive and reject unknowns, client-side not as important??)

- key ordering of objects / maps ??? {"foo": 1, "bar": 2} equals {"bar": 2, "foo": 1}

## Formats

### JSON Format

The JSON format defines the JSON representation of Conjure-defined types, collections and primitives. Implementations
of Conjure clients/servers MUST expect all HTTP requests and responses, and header parameters to be represented in this way.
The data types in the Conjure Specification are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Wright
Draft 00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-00#section-4.2).

### Plain Format

The Plain format defines the raw representation of Conjure primitives. There is no raw representation of
Conjure-defined types and collections. Implementations of Conjure clients/servers MUST expect all path and query
parameters to be represented in this way.

### Canonical Format

The Canonical format defines an additional representation of Conjure-defined types, collections and primitives for use
when a type has multiple valid formats that are conceptually equivalent. Implementations of Conjure clients/servers
MUST convert types (even if implicitly) from their JSON/Plain format to their canonical form when determining equality.

## Data Types

### <a name="collectionDataTypes"></a>Collection Data Types

Collections can be omitted if they are empty or in the case of optionals absent. The collection data types defined by
the Conjure Specification are:

Conjure Name |  JSON Type  | Canonical Representation | Comments
------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ | --------
list\<V>     | Array[V]    | No ambiguity             | An array where all the elements are of type V. If the associated field is omitted then the value is an empty list.
set\<V>      | Array[V]    | No ambiguity             | An array where all elements are of type V and are unique. The order the elements appear in the list does not impact equality.
map\<K, V>   | Map[K,V]   | No ambiguity             | A map where all keys are of type K  and all values are of type V. K MUST be a Conjure primitive type or an alias of a Conjure primitive type. If the type is non-string, then it is serialized into a quoted version of its plain reprehension.
optional\<V> | V or `null` | `null` if absent otherwise the value | The value is considered absent if it is null or its associated field is omitted.

### <a name="complexDataTypes"></a>Complex Data Types

The complex data types defined by the Conjure Specification are:

Conjure Name | JSON Type | Canonical Representation | Comments
------------ | --------- | ------------------------ | --------
alias        |  -        | No ambiguity             | An Alias is a type that is a shorthand name for another type. An Alias MUST be serialized in the same way the aliased type would be.
enum         | `string`  | No ambiguity             | An Enum is a type that represents a fixed set of `string` values.
error        | `object`  | No ambiguity             | An Error is a type that represents a structured, non-successful response. It includes three required fields: `errorCode`, `errorName`, `errorInstanceId`, and an optional field `parameters`.
object       | `object`  | No ambiguity             | An Object is a type that represents an `object` with a predefined set of fields with associated types.
union        | `object`  | No ambiguity             | A Union is a type that represents a possibility from a fixed set of Objects. A Union is a JSON object with two fields: a `type` field which specifies the name of the variant, and a field which is the name of the variant which contains the payload.

An example error type would be serialized as follows:

```js
{
  "errorCode": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
  "errorName": "MyApplication:DatasetNotFound",
  "errorInstanceId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "parameters": {
    "datasetId": "123abc",
    "userName": "yourUserName"
  }
}
```

An example union type would be serialized as follows:

```js
{
  "type": "serviceLog",
  "serviceLog": {
    // fields of ServiceLog object
  }
}
```
