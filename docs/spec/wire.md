# Conjure Wire Specification

_This document defines the serialization format of Conjure defined types._

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP
14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)
[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Formats

### JSON Format

The JSON format defines the JSON representation of Conjure-defined types, collections and primitives. Implementations
of Conjure clients/servers MUST expect all HTTP requests and responses, and header parameters to be represented in this way.
The data types in the Conjure Specification are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Wright
Draft 00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-00#section-4.2).

### Plain Format

The Plain format defines the raw representation of Conjure primitives. There is no raw representation of
Conjure-defined types and collections. Implementations of Conjure clients/servers MUST expect all path and query
parameters to be represented in this way.

### Canonical Format

The Canonical format defines an additional representation of Conjure-defined types, collections and primitives for use
when a type has multiple valid formats that are conceptually equivalent. Implementations of Conjure clients/servers
MUST convert types (even if implicitly) from their JSON/Plain format to their canonical form when determining equality.

## Data Types

### <a name="primitiveDataTypes"></a>Primitive Data Types

The primitive data types defined by the Conjure Specification are:

Example format conversions to canonical format:

### <a name="collectionDataTypes"></a>Collection Data Types

Collections can be omitted if they are empty or in the case of optionals absent. The collection data types defined by
the Conjure Specification are:

Conjure Name |  JSON Type  | Canonical Representation | Comments
------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ | --------
list\<V>     | Array[V]    | No ambiguity             | An array where all the elements are of type V. If the associated field is omitted then the value is an empty list.
set\<V>      | Array[V]    | No ambiguity             | An array where all elements are of type V and are unique. The order the elements appear in the list does not impact equality.
map\<K, V>   | Map[K,V]   | No ambiguity             | A map where all keys are of type K  and all values are of type V. K MUST be a Conjure primitive type or an alias of a Conjure primitive type. If the type is non-string, then it is serialized into a quoted version of its plain reprehension.
optional\<V> | V or `null` | `null` if absent otherwise the value | The value is considered absent if it is null or its associated field is omitted.

### <a name="complexDataTypes"></a>Complex Data Types

The complex data types defined by the Conjure Specification are:

Conjure Name | JSON Type | Canonical Representation | Comments
------------ | --------- | ------------------------ | --------
alias        |  -        | No ambiguity             | An Alias is a type that is a shorthand name for another type. An Alias MUST be serialized in the same way the aliased type would be.
enum         | `string`  | No ambiguity             | An Enum is a type that represents a fixed set of `string` values.
error        | `object`  | No ambiguity             | An Error is a type that represents a structured, non-successful response. It includes three required fields: `errorCode`, `errorName`, `errorInstanceId`, and an optional field `parameters`.
object       | `object`  | No ambiguity             | An Object is a type that represents an `object` with a predefined set of fields with associated types.
union        | `object`  | No ambiguity             | A Union is a type that represents a possibility from a fixed set of Objects. A Union is a JSON object with two fields: a `type` field which specifies the name of the variant, and a field which is the name of the variant which contains the payload.

An example error type would be serialized as follows:

```js
{
  "errorCode": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
  "errorName": "MyApplication:DatasetNotFound",
  "errorInstanceId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "parameters": {
    "datasetId": "123abc",
    "userName": "yourUserName"
  }
}
```

An example union type would be serialized as follows:

```js
{
  "type": "serviceLog",
  "serviceLog": {
    // fields of ServiceLog object
  }
}
```
