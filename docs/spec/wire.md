# Conjure Wire Specification

_This document defines how Conjure clients and servers should make and receive network requests and reponses over HTTP._

This document describes how endpoints and types defined in a Conjure IR file should result in network requests/response.

## HTTP Requests

TODO link to some official HTTP spec, define HTTP 1 / 1.1 / 2.

- **SSL/TLS** - Conjure clients MUST support requests using TLS (HTTPS) (TODO versions) and MAY optionally support insecure HTTP requests.

- **HTTP Methods** - Conjure clients MUST send requests using the HTTP Method specified in the IR.

- **Path parameters** - For Conjure endpoints which have user-defined path parameters, the client MUST interpolate values for each of these path parameters. Values must be serialized using the PLAIN format and also _URL encoded_ (TODO link) to ensure special characters don't break.

  ```
  /some/url/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{id}/{file}/{line}
  ->
  /some/url/joe/recipe-server/pulls/123/var%2Fconf%2Finstall.yml/53
  ```

- **Headers** - Conjure endpoints which define 'headers' must be translated to HTTP Headers (TODO link). Header names are case insensitive.  Header values must be serialized using the PLAIN format. Header values which are `optional<T>` must be omitted entirely if the value is not present, otherwise just serialized as `PLAIN(T)`.

- **User-agent** - Requests MUST include a `User-Agent` header. (TODO specify an exact format????)

- **Authorization** - If an endpoint's `auth` field is present, clients must behave as follows:
  - `HeaderAuthType` - Clients MUST send a header with name `Authorization` and case-sensitive value `Bearer {{string}}` where `{{string}}` is a user-provided string.
  - `CookieAuthType` - Clients MUST send a cookie header with name `cookie` and value `{{cookieName}}={{value}}`, where `{{cookieName}}` comes from the IR and `{{value}}` is a user-provided value.

- **Additional headers** - Clients MAY inject additional headers (e.g. for Zipkin tracing, or `Fetch-User-Agent`), as long as these do not clash with any headers already defined in the IR.

- **Query parameters** - If an endpoint specifies one or more parameters of type `query`, then a client MUST add a query string to the outgoing URL as per the HTTP spec (TODO link). If any value of type `optional<T>` is not present, then the query key must be omitted.  Otherwise, it must be serialized as `PLAIN(T)` and url encoded (TODO link). TODO clarify if lists/sets/maps/binary are allowed.

  ```
  /some/url/search?string=foo%20bar&offset=60&limit=20
  ```

- **Body serialization** - If an endpoint defines an argument of type `body` clients MUST serialize the user-provided value using the `JSON` encoding scheme defined below. TODO content-length ??? TODO binary streaming upload ??, TODO string examples. TODO empty containers. TODO nulls.

## HTTP Responses

- **Status codes** - Conjure servers MUST respond with `204` status code if an endpoint returns `optional<T>` where `<T>` is not present. Servers MUST respond with `200` status code for all other successful requests, including empty maps, sets, and lists.

- **Response body** - Conjure servers MUST serialize return values using the `JSON` encoding scheme defined below. The body MUST be omitted if the return type is `optional<T>` and `T` is not present. Return type `binary` must be written directly to the body. TODO define (optional<binary> where binary is empty or not, optional.empty) and content length.

- **Content-type** - Conjure servers MUST respond to requests with the `Content-Type` header corresponding to the endpoint's return type. TODO(double check text/plain content type)
  ```
    binary -> "application/octet-stream"
    alias<binary> -> "application/octet-stream"
    <everything else> -> "aplication/json;charset=utf-8"
  ```
- **Errors** - If Conjure servers return errors, they MUST serialize the erorrs using the `JSON` encoding scheme defined below. In addition, the servers MUST send a http status code correponding the error codes defined in the IR.
  ```
  PERMISSION_DENIED (403)
  INVALID_ARGUMENT(400)
  NOT_FOUND (404)
  CONFLICT (409)
  REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE (413)
  FAILED_PRECONDITION (500)
  INTERNAL (500)
  TIMEOUT (500)
  CUSTOM_CLIENT (400)
  CUSTOM_SERVER (500)
  ```

## Client Behavior
- **Forward compatibility** Clients MUST tolerate extra headers and unknown fields in JSON responses. This ensures that old clients will continue to work with new servers.
- **Client base url** Conjure endpoint definitions only specify http path suffix without scheme, host, or port. Clients MUST allow users to specify server base url.


## Server Behavior

- Behaviour
  - Server-side MUST reject unknown fields in JSON format (TODO explain motivation - avoids silent failures, #failfast)
  - Server-side MUST NOT reject extra extra headers, MAY reject extra query-params
  - set equality using canonical formats (double, )
  - round-trip reserialization of unknown enum/union variants
  - server GZIP compression
  - server OPTIONS http method for browser compatibility
  - server CORS headers???
  - server http 1/2

- Formats
  - PLAIN
  - JSON
    - coerce null/abent -> Optional.empty(), empty list, empty set
    - explain why optional<optional<T>> is banned
    - strings are UTF8
    - caveats for double Infinity NaN



<!--
TODO

- should we mention CIPHERS????

- strictness / leniency - can you expect that a server or a client is already compliant, should you be defensive?? (server-side : you must be defensive and reject unknowns, client-side not as important??)

- key ordering of objects / maps ??? {"foo": 1, "bar": 2} equals {"bar": 2, "foo": 1}

## Formats

### JSON Format

The JSON format defines the JSON representation of Conjure-defined types, collections and primitives. Implementations
of Conjure clients/servers MUST expect all HTTP requests and responses, and header parameters to be represented in this way.
The data types in the Conjure Specification are based on the types supported by the [JSON Schema Specification Wright
Draft 00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-00#section-4.2).

### Plain Format

The Plain format defines the raw representation of Conjure primitives. There is no raw representation of
Conjure-defined types and collections. Implementations of Conjure clients/servers MUST expect all path and query
parameters to be represented in this way.

### Canonical Format

The Canonical format defines an additional representation of Conjure-defined types, collections and primitives for use
when a type has multiple valid formats that are conceptually equivalent. Implementations of Conjure clients/servers
MUST convert types (even if implicitly) from their JSON/Plain format to their canonical form when determining equality.

## Data Types

### <a name="collectionDataTypes"></a>Collection Data Types

Collections can be omitted if they are empty or in the case of optionals absent. The collection data types defined by
the Conjure Specification are:

Conjure Name |  JSON Type  | Canonical Representation | Comments
------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ | --------
list\<V>     | Array[V]    | No ambiguity             | An array where all the elements are of type V. If the associated field is omitted then the value is an empty list.
set\<V>      | Array[V]    | No ambiguity             | An array where all elements are of type V and are unique. The order the elements appear in the list does not impact equality.
map\<K, V>   | Map[K,V]   | No ambiguity             | A map where all keys are of type K  and all values are of type V. K MUST be a Conjure primitive type or an alias of a Conjure primitive type. If the type is non-string, then it is serialized into a quoted version of its plain reprehension.
optional\<V> | V or `null` | `null` if absent otherwise the value | The value is considered absent if it is null or its associated field is omitted.

### <a name="complexDataTypes"></a>Complex Data Types

The complex data types defined by the Conjure Specification are:

Conjure Name | JSON Type | Canonical Representation | Comments
------------ | --------- | ------------------------ | --------
alias        |  -        | No ambiguity             | An Alias is a type that is a shorthand name for another type. An Alias MUST be serialized in the same way the aliased type would be.
enum         | `string`  | No ambiguity             | An Enum is a type that represents a fixed set of `string` values.
error        | `object`  | No ambiguity             | An Error is a type that represents a structured, non-successful response. It includes three required fields: `errorCode`, `errorName`, `errorInstanceId`, and an optional field `parameters`.
object       | `object`  | No ambiguity             | An Object is a type that represents an `object` with a predefined set of fields with associated types.
union        | `object`  | No ambiguity             | A Union is a type that represents a possibility from a fixed set of Objects. A Union is a JSON object with two fields: a `type` field which specifies the name of the variant, and a field which is the name of the variant which contains the payload.

An example error type would be serialized as follows:

```js
{
  "errorCode": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
  "errorName": "MyApplication:DatasetNotFound",
  "errorInstanceId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "parameters": {
    "datasetId": "123abc",
    "userName": "yourUserName"
  }
}
```

An example union type would be serialized as follows:

```js
{
  "type": "serviceLog",
  "serviceLog": {
    // fields of ServiceLog object
  }
}
```
