    Fix Conjure enum mixing short-hand and fully-specified value types

    ## Before this PR

    For an array of `oneOf` types, JSON Schema picks a single type that the whole array must match. I'm not sure if this is correct JSON schema or just the implementation we're using. It seems a little odd?

    In any case, the example fails the json schema test with:
    ```
    Unexpected JSON schema error 'oneOf' $.types.definitions.objects.MyEnum.values[1]: should be valid to one and only one of schema, but more than one are valid: {"$ref":"#/definitions/UpperCase"}{"$ref":"#/definitions/EnumValueDefinition"}
    ```

    ## After this PR

    The example passes the test.

    I've also renamed the directory the example YML files are in so they're picked up as Conjure files by the IDE.
