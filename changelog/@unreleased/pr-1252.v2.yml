    Create Conjure JSON schema

    ## Before this PR
    No IDE support at all for writing Conjure human-readable format

    ## After this PR
    JSON schema exists for the human readable format. I will follow up with a PR to schemastore.org to add this to their catalog.

    See #1239

    We get some auto-completion in IntelliJ:

    And some basic validation checks:

    ## Possible downsides?
    This format is defined only in Jackson/Immutables at the moment, so it can't easily be automatically converted to JSON without losing information. It's therefore (painstakingly!) hand-crafted. I figure it's a slow-moving spec, so shouldn't be an issue given the benefits we get from this.
